# Why public source?

While our mod is [All Rights Reserved](LICENSE.md), we believe in supporting the wider modding community. Many modders
use code examples to help them learn how to work with Minecraft and the mod loader they've chosen - while our code
may not be of an absolutely professional quality, we hope that its availability helps someone else with their
own modding work. 

To that end, feel free to look over our code for examples of how we've solved the problems we encountered while
writing this mod - just remember that [All Rights Reserved](LICENSE.md) means that you can't take any of the code or
assets for your own projects.

We reserve the right to enforce our copyright - via the DMCA (or other country-relevant legislation), acquisition of
teeth, or sacrifice in our weekly demonic ritual.
